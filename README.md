<!-- ### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

With this path, I want to continue learning more about **Responsive Design** and how to work across different devices with **Flexbox**, also I want continue using  **BEM methodology** and perfect the technique in aspects like name the classes, also I want to improve in modularize the component's styles with **Sass** and learn about **Conventional Commits**.
